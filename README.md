# Wildfire Response and Prediction Backend

This backend application is built with Flask and serves two main functions:  
1. **Resource Deployment Optimization**: Processes current wildfire data to optimize the deployment of firefighting resources.  
2. **Fire Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict future wildfire occurrences based on environmental data.

The solution is designed for managing wildfire incidents and includes API endpoints for both immediate resource deployment and future fire prediction.
